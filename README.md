OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project Description
The Student Grade Manager is a Python-based program designed to help users input, track, and manage student grades. It enables users to record grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display an overall performance summary, including the letter grade and GPA. The program uses a user-friendly command-line interface and offers robust error handling to ensure a smooth experience.

Key Features

1. Grade Management:

Add grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
Update existing grades if needed.

2. Performance Calculation:

Calculate the average grade across all subjects.
Convert the average grade into a letter grade (A-F).
Compute the GPA based on a 4.0 scale.

3. User-Friendly Interface:

Clear menus for navigation.
Simple and intuitive prompts for data input.

4. Error Handling:

Validates grades to ensure they are within the 0–100 range.
Handles invalid or non-numeric inputs gracefully.

5. Exit Option:
Allows the user to terminate the program at any time.

How It Works

1. User Input:
2. 
Users can add or edit grades by specifying a subject and entering a numeric grade.
Grades are stored in a dictionary for easy access and management.

3. View Grades:
4. 
Users can display all recorded grades, along with their corresponding subjects.

5. Calculate Performance:
The program calculates the average of all entered grades.
It determines the corresponding letter grade and GPA.
Displays the results in a clear and organized format.

6. Exit Program:

Users can safely exit the program after completing their tasks.
Technical Details
Programming Language: Python
Core Concepts Used:
Loops (while)
Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
Dictionaries for data storage
Functions for modular design
Input Validation: Ensures grades are numeric and fall within a valid range (0–100).

User Workflow

1. Start the program and view the main menu.
2. Add or update grades for various subjects or assignments.
3. View all recorded grades.
4. Calculate and display overall performance metrics:
Average Grade
Letter Grade
GPA
5. Repeat the process as needed or exit the program.

Use Cases

1. Teachers and Tutors: Manage student grades for individual assignments or exams.
2. Students: Track personal academic progress across subjects.
3. Programming Learners: Understand key Python concepts like dictionaries, loops, and input validation.

Potential Enhancements

1. Persistent Storage: Save and retrieve grades from a file.
2. Weighting: Allow weighted averages for different assignment types (e.g., homework, exams).
3. Multi-Student Support: Extend functionality to handle multiple students’ grades.
4. Graphical Interface: Use a GUI library like tkinter or PyQt for a more user-friendly interface.
This project serves as a practical example of how Python can be used to create effective, real-world applications while demonstrating fundamental programming principles.
